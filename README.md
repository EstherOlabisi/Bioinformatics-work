## Projects and their descriptions

1. Alignment of sequences to reference genomes: assessing the quality of reference genomes and the performance of sequence aligners.
2. Analysis of RNAseq counts: exploring differential gene expression in luminal and basal cell subpopulations of mice.  
3. Supervised Learning for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD): developing machine learning models (gradient boosting, k nearest neighbor, random forest, ridge, and decision tree classifiers) to predict CVD based on several risk factors.
4. Variant Calling (Identifying SNPs): utilizing Freebayes and Bcftools variant callers to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genomic sequences of burbot fish.
