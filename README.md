## Projects and their descriptions

1. Alignment of sequences to reference genomes: assess the quality of reference genomes and the performance of sequence aligners - **R and Shell.**
2. Canine Lymphoma Research: train and test machine learning models to predict B and T cell immunophenotypes. Hypothesis testing and survival analysis - **R.**
3. Master's Capstone Project: develop a GUI app to visualize proteomics data processed in Perseus software - **R and RShiny.**
4. Supervised Learning for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD): train and test machine learning models in (gradient boosting, k nearest neighbor, random forest, ridge, and decision tree classifiers) to predict CVD based on several risk factors - **Python.**
5. Variant Calling (Identifying SNPs): utilizing Freebayes and Bcftools variant callers to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genomic sequences of burbot fish - **R and Shell.**
