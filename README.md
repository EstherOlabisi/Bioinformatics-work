## Projects and their descriptions

1. Alignment of sequences to reference genomes: assess the quality of reference genomes and the performance of sequence aligners - **R and Shell.**
2. Canine Lymphoma Research: train and test machine learning models (K Nearest Neighbor and Linear Support Vector Machine) to predict B and T cell immunophenotypes. Hypothesis testing and survival analysis - **R.**
3. Master's Capstone Project: develop a GUI app to visualize proteomics data processed in Perseus software - **R and RShiny.**
4. Supervised Learning for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD): train and test machine learning models in (Gradient Boosting, K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Ridge, and Decision Tree Classifiers) to predict CVD based on several risk factors - **Python.**
5. Variant Calling (Identifying SNPs): utilize Freebayes and Bcftools variant callers to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genomic sequences of burbot fish - **R and Shell.**
