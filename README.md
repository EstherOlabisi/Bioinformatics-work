1. Applying several genomic methods in the analysis of DNA-seq and RNAseq data: 
2. Supervised Learning - Cardiovascular Disease (CVD): machine learning models (gradient boosting, k nearest neighbor, random forest, ridge, and decision tree classifiers) predicting CVD based on several risk factors.
3. Variant Calling (Identifying SNPs): utilizing Freebayes and Bcftools variant callers to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genomic sequences of burbot fish.
